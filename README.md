## What is the Mushroom Dashboard Strategy?

Mushroom Dashboard Strategy provides a strategy for Home Assistant to automatically generate a dashboard using Mushroom
cards.

It generates cards for your Home Assistants entities and areas, divided over several views.
Besides a Home view from where you can enter a subview of your areas, a separate view for lights, fans and other domains
are generated for easy access to your entities.

### Features

- 🛠 Automatically create dashboard with three lines of yaml.
- 😍 Built-in Views for device-specific controls.
- 🎨 Many options to customize to fit your needs.
